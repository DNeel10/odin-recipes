        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb grape tomatoes</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh basil, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion, diced</li>
            <li>Spaghetti noodles</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti noodles and cook for 10 minutes or until al dente; Reserve about a cup of the pasta water before fully draining the noodles.</li>
            <li>While noodles cook, saute onion and garlic in a large skillet over medium heat</li>
            <li>Once onions become translucent, add tomatoes to the pan and cover.</li>
            <li>After the tomatoes have softened, use a potato masher to smash the tomatoes.  Continue to cook over medium heat until the tomatoes are fully softened.</li>
            <li>Add cooked spaghetti noodles directly to the pan with the tomato mixture and stir.  Add a few tablespoons of the reserved cooking liquid while stiring the noodles until the sauce begins to thicken and cling to the noodles.</li>
            <li>Add the shredded parmesan cheese to the noodles and continue stirring, occasionally adding additional pasta water as needed to get sauce to desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle basil onto pasta and serve.</li>
        </ol>
